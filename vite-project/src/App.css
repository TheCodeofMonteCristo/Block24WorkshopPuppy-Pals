/*Overall Pseudocode Explaining how this Code functions:


Overall App Styling:

The .App class styles the main application container using Flexbox to 
center its content both vertically and horizontally. 
It also applies padding and a light background color.


Puppy List Styling:

The .puppy-list class removes default list styles and 
ensures the list is displayed neatly. It also restricts 
the maximum width to improve readability.


Puppy List Item Styling:

The .puppy-list p class styles individual puppy names with 
padding, background color, and rounded corners. 
It also includes a hover effect for better user interaction.

Featured Puppy Details:

The .featured-puppy class styles the section 
displaying details about the selected puppy, 
including borders and padding for a visually appealing layout.

Featured Puppy Name and Details:

The <h2> and <ul> elements within the .featured-puppy 
class are styled to differentiate the puppy's name and details clearly.

Refresh Button:

The .refresh-button class styles a button that 
can be used to refresh or update the puppy list. 
It includes hover effects for better interactivity.

Error Message Styling:

The .error-message class is introduced to provide visual feedback 
in case of errors, using red text to draw attention.

Loading Spinner:

The .loading-spinner class styles a spinner element 
that can be displayed while data is loading. It includes keyframes 
for animation to create a smooth spinning effect.

Media Queries for Responsiveness:

A media query is included to adjust styles for smaller screens, 
ensuring a good user experience on mobile devices by reducing padding and font sizes.

Summary:
This expanded CSS code not only enhances the visual styling 
of the application but also introduces additional elements 
like a refresh button, error messages, and a loading spinner.
